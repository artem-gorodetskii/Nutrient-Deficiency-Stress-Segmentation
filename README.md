# Nutrient-Deficiency-Stress-Segmentation

This repository contains an implementation of a Unet-based model for segmentation of Nutrient Deficiency Stress (see [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09654)).

# Dataset
The dataset is available at [link](https://registry.opendata.aws/intelinair_longitudinal_nutrient_deficiency/):

# Model
The model is based on custom UNet architecture (see [model.py](https://github.com/artem-gorodetskii/Nutrient-Deficiency-Stress-Segmentation/blob/master/model.py)). Input to the model represents combination of three images.
